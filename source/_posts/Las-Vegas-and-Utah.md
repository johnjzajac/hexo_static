Went to Las Vegas recently and took a day out of that trip to go to Utah (I'm not big on gambling). I feel like everyone should go to Las Vegas at least once in their life just to see what everyone talks about. Luckily we found tickets for less than $100, so I figured that I may as well go and see all this hype.

Overall, I'm not a big gambler, so it was a pretty dull place to me. They essentially stuck a gambling metropolis in the middle of the desert and called it Las Vegas. Good thing me and a buddy of mine rented out a car for the day and drove out to Utah to do the Angel's Landing hike which was well worth it.

Hey there! If you made it here, that means you are actually somewhat interested in myself and what I do. Here goes.......

Well, I go to the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and study computer science. Fun fact, UIC was the only school I applied to coming out of high school since I was pretty set on going to the Navy for most of my teenage years. I decided to pursue computer science since I messed around with technology, computers, and everything alike for most of my life so it seemed like the right fit. 3 years deep into the program and it was one of the better decisions I have made in my lifetime.

When it comes to computer science, what interests me most would be cryptography, computer graphics, image visualization, and data mining. I'm heavily invested in music and photography, so constantly being on Photoshop or music streaming services has helped me to spur that interest and dig down to what lies below what we see on the screen.

Yes, I spend a lot of time on my computer and yes, I spend a lot of that time doing CS related projects and side work, but I also spend my time on my computer and the internet focused around music. I absolutely love techno and house. I generally spend a good 30 minutes to an hour a day on finding new music. If I had more time, I would sift through tracks and mixes and sets all day on SoundCloud. Some of my favorite artists include Tale Of Us, Mind Against, Recondite, Woo York, Dixon, Rampa, Ã‚me, Bedouin, Kobosil, Loco Dice, Carl Cox, Skream, Solomun, etc. No artist or group will ever top Tale Of Us for me, though. I know their discography more than I know myself -- I also know their label's (Afterlife) discography like the back of my hand. There is just something about their ethereal, classically-infused techno that encompasses everything I need in a track. Besides the more electronic based genres of music, I'm pretty big on Tame Impala and bands alike.

I am also very, very interested in photography. Throughout my site you can find a bunch of pictures I have taken from right here in Chicago and its surrounding areas, along with pictures I have taken whenever I have traveled out of the state -- most recently being Poland, Iceland, and Utah. I used to do a lot of concert photography, but have let up recently as I prefer to focus my efforts on school and the future ahead. Would love to go back and do more photography at concerts, shows, and festivals, but more opportunities lie ahead.

Besides the above, not sure what else I can mention. I support Manchester United and Real Madrid. Chicago Cubs fan born and raised (Portage Park reppin'). Top places I still want to travel to are Alaska, Faroe Islands, Antarctica, Patagonia, Berlin, New Zealand, and the Scandinavian region to name a few. Big fan of the cold, the snow, and grueling walks and hikes. Those conditions tend to have something gorgeous at the end of their routes.

Enjoy the rest of my site and feel free to contact me whenever!
